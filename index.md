## Welcome!
I'm an incoming Ph.D. student in Brown University's Economics Department (starting August 2024). Previously, I worked as a Predoctoral Research Fellow at Microsoft Research's Economics & Computation Group. Before that, I worked as a Data Analyst at One Drop and as an ML Intern for two summers at Lockheed Martin. I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2021 with a double major in Economics and Computer Science. 

I am highly interested in studying both the drivers of technology and the impacts of modern technology on human decision-making. Current and past research that I have been involved with includes projects related to (i) how AI has affected jobs in the healthcare industry, (ii) the spread of misinformation in social networks, (iii) understanding how users respond to streaming-related ads on search engines, (iv) modeling biased belief formation in the presence of unique and repeated information, (vi) solving for equilibrium beliefs in a model of social networks with polarized users and platform moderation, and (vii) measuring labor turnover in markets with state-funded worker training grants. Other interests of mine include playing soccer and basketball, philosophy of mind, music (learning the guitar!), and stand-up comedy.

Thanks for visiting!
